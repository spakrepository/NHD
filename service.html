                  <strong>Social Media Management is the act of monitoring and participating in social conversations across platforms.</strong>
                   <p class="text-justify">
                      The easiest way to view social media management is to consider that it
                      includes 3 major social media disciplines: social listening, social
                      analytics and social engagement. Social listening is when you gather
                      everything that is being said about your brand. Social analytics help you
                      understand all the social media chatter and relate it to possible
                      business changes. Social engagement is the act of interacting, usually 1-
                      on-1 but occasionally at scale, with customers over social channels.
                      Most businesses take on social engagement to close the loop with
                      customers on their issues
